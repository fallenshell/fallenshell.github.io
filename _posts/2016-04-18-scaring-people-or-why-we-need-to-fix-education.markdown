title: Scaring people, or why we need to fix education

A few days ago, I was happily coding about. Being a high school student, you don't really have much time for personal projects anymore, which is why sometimes I decide to bring my laptop to school to experiment (and learn!) on my own, coding and getting hands-on on projects like my binary converter, among others. I love learning and reading on my free time; something not many from my generation seem to like, preferring to spend time on BuzzFeed or Snapchat. That's okay, as everyone is different. However, an incident that happened while I was programming on my lunch time induced me in an interesting line of thought on why education is failing, and we need to fix it.

So, as I happily debugged my code, a teacher looked at me. "What are you doing?", she screamed. I jumped off my chair, startled, and gazed at her. She looked at Vim, confused, asking "what the hell" it was. I told her I was simply programming, and there was no cause for concern. The teacher kept insisting I cannot, in her own words, "do that at school". After a few minutes of endless dirty looks and insistence, she let it go, with her final words being "I will mention this incident to the principal." I laughed endlessly after she left, considering the irony of the fact they actually have coding lessons for the elementary kids at school (using code.org I think). I was in for another laugh. But at the same time I wanted to see her reaction to, for example, `cat /dev/urandom`, for science. 

I wrote a little Python script that outputs a bunch of binary in green text mixed with urandom output. As you can expect from what I told a few sentences ago, she freaked out. She told me she "talked with the principal about the incident" and "it's prohibited, you can't do it". I was mad, but didn't really stop programming, and won't until she takes me to the principal for me to appeal.
